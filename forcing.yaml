years:
  - 2018 # The beginning year of interest, bgn_yr. May go as low as 1979.
  - 2019 # This must be at least bgn_yr + 1 to represent a single year. e.g. bgn_yr = 2018, end_year = 2019 means grab data throughout 2018 only. Default 2024 means data through 2023 grabbed.

cid: -1 # The divide_id chunk size. Default -1 means all divide_ids in a basin. A small value may be needed for very large basins with many catchments.
